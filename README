This fork tries to consolidate all mysql2 compatability changes for the ar-extensions gem.

It includes:

 - the ShoeDazzle fork for the import extension & adapter
 - the tracksimple mysql2_support branch for import extension, plus some lower level compatability changes

Please fork and improve futher support -- this version has not been thoroughly tested yet (make this untrue!).
